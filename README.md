# OnlineRockPaperScissor
Rock Paper Scissors Online in Python which we have developed is a cross-platform game that should work on any modern desktop operating systems. This will be able to run on Windows and Mac OS X as well.
All the Python scripts in this project are written for Python 3.x. The client GUI requires Python PyGame module.
